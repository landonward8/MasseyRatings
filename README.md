# MasseyRatings
Developed a ranking system for NBA teams using Massey's method, which was previously employed in the BCS ranking system, using Python. Implemented algorithms to analyze team performance data, including wins, losses, and opponent strength, to calculate rankings. I chose this assignment because it showcases my critial thinking skills by Using Linear Algebra and Python to build the rankings.
